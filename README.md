# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective categories.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data**: Contains the MNIST dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **models**: Stores trained model files for digit recognition.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **src**: Source code for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **static**: Static files for the web application (if applicable).
- **templates**: HTML templates for the web application (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### Testing the Model

To evaluate the model performance, run:
```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py
```

### Deployment (Optional)

If deploying the model as a web application, follow these additional steps:
1. Implement the web application using Flask/Django (or your preferred framework).
2. Serve the trained model using the web application.
3. Update the necessary configurations for deployment.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy on the test dataset.
- Confusion matrix and evaluation metrics are available in the `notebooks` directory.

## Credits

- Special thanks to the creators of the MNIST dataset for providing the data.
